# CreditCard_Fraud_Detection

## Description:
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, along with popular libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which includes anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Key Features:

### Data Exploration: 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of features, class imbalance, and correlations between variables.

### Preprocessing: 
Data preprocessing techniques such as standardization, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced data are applied to prepare the dataset for model training.

### Model Selection: 
Several machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM are implemented to build predictive models for fraud detection.

### Cross-Validation: 
Robust cross-validation techniques such as RepeatedKFold and StratifiedKFold are employed to evaluate the models' performance and ensure reliable results.

### Evaluation Metrics: 
The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

### Comparison: 
Different cross-validation methods and oversampling techniques are compared to identify the most suitable approach for this specific dataset.


This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing machine learning techniques for fraud detection in real-world scenarios, with credits to KJ Gam Tech Studio for their insightful tutorials and guidance.
